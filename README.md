I have written 37 basic JavaScript programs, each demonstrating core concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and DOM manipulation. These programs are designed to showcase a variety of techniques, including simple user input handling, arithmetic operations, and interactive web elements. The code is organized and optimized for easy understanding, making it an excellent resource for beginners learning JavaScript. The repository on GitHub contains examples of different types of programs that address common programming tasks, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and learning in web development.
